# Rust Learning Resources

Are you looking to learn or try rust? Here's a collection of resources to help you get your foot in the door.

[Cheat Sheet](https://cheats.rs)

[The Official Rust Book (Free)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)

[Rustlings (Small, bite-sized training exercises)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)

I recommend skimming the rust book, then reading a bit of cheats.rs (the density of information makes it really fun to read). Then you can either fully read the rust book or start a project about something you are passionate about.

I recommend joining the official Rust discord server, it may help you when you're stuck.
